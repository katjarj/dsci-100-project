    "### Purpose\n",
    "This project revolves around data collected by a research group in Computer Science at UBC, led by Frank Wood, surrounding how people play video games. The research team has set up a Minecraft server—which they call PLAICraft—that records players' actions as they navigate through the world. This project seeks to analyze the team's data to assist the researchers in targeting their recruitment efforts to the right audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are analyzing the data to answer the question: **Can a player's age predict the number of hours they spend playing PLAIcraft?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analyzing the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we will be using data from the provided `players.csv` data set—specifically, we will need the `Age` and `played_hours` variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we load in the data."

    "In this project, we investigated whether a player’s age could predict the number of hours they spend playing PLAICraft. Through our analysis, we found that age alone was a weak predictor of gameplay time. Adding additional variables such as subscription status and gender improved the model slightly, but not substantially. All models consistently underestimated the actual number of hours played, especially for younger players, such as the 9-year-old in the test set who logged over 160 hours—far more than predicted by any model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also discovered that a large portion of our data consisted of players aged around 17, indicating a heavily skewed age distribution. This concentration likely biased the models toward average behavior within that group, limiting generalizability to other age ranges."

    "These results were not entirely what we expected. We hypothesized that age might have a clearer correlation with time spent playing; however, the data suggests that age alone is not sufficient to capture the complexity of player engagement. Other unmeasured factors—such as player motivation, free time availability, or interest in gaming—likely play a much larger role.\n"

    "These findings can have several impacts or implications, especially for game design, advertising and player engagement strategies. Next time while we are recruiting players, we can use the knowledge that age alone is not sufficient parameter to understand player behaviour. Rather, we need to consider including other behavioural characteristics such as session frequency, peak play times, motivation or play style preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could also help researchers to focus more on other demographic traits to predict gaming experience, and those insights can help to inspire adaptive in-game experience or tutorials derived by actual involvement rather than age related guesses. Also, this study shows that oversimplification can lead to missing deeeper truths and it stresses the importance of diverse datasets from psychological perspective or contextual frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This opens up many interesting questions, including what other factors might influence the gameplay time more effectively than age?, or can in-game behvorial data perform better predicting player engagement than the demographic information. Some other questions could be, how the engagement can change with time? Can there be any seasonal pattern? or can the player experience level be a factor in long-term engagement? Also, in future we can try using different prediction models to compare and see if they perform differently that KNN for this assignment."
